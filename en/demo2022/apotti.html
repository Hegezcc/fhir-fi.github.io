    <h1>Apotti</h1>
    <p>Apotti is a unique information and enterprise resource planning (ERP) system also on a
      global scale as it is the first in the world to bring together social care and health care
      information. It is an Epic-based system for 47 000 social and health care professionals,
      offering better health and well-being for 1,7 million municipality residents. More than 5,000
      social care and health care professionals have participated in developing the Apotti
      system.</p>
    <p>Apotti offers extensive open interfaces and integration services (for more information, go
      to <a href="https://open.epic.com">open.epic.com</a>) that enable the Apotti system to be
      reinforced with innovative third-party services that give added value.</p>
    <p>The Apotti ecosystem partners can, with the help of the HL7 ® FHIR ®standard, seamlessly
      integrate their solutions to the Apotti social care and health care data. Apotti also uses
      the national suomi.fi services for strong electronic identification of users as well as the
      Kanta services for archiving and transfer of data. Thus, the system can be built to meet the
      requirements of the Finnish national legislation.</p>
    <p>Alongside Apotti Finnish startups and other operators become part of the Epic application
      list and can consequently find pathways to the global market.</p>
