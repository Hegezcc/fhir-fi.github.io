# FHIR Demo 2023 Development site

This directory is useful for FHIR Demo participants to check the contents of their demos and issue pull requests for changes.

The democase is built on top of the Gatsby framework for single-page apps. The actual development branch is [fhir-demo-2023-gatsby](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/fhir-demo-2023-gatsby/fhir-demo-2023). If you're up to it, please issue pull requests to that branch.
