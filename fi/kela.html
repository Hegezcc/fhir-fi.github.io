    <h2 id="kantaPHR">Kanta PHR</h2>
    <p>Kanta Personal Health Record (Kanta PHR) is a national Kanta service in which users can save
      their wellbeing data. The service was deployed for the first-phase production use in spring
      2018. Currently, citizens can record their wellbeing data in Kanta PHR with accepted
      wellbeing applications developed for this purpose.</p>
    <p>In future, users may give their consent to healthcare and social welfare professionals to
      use the data in support of their patient care or service relationship.</p>
    <p>Anyone can develop a new wellbeing application that utilises Kanta PHR. The applications can
      be server-based or mobile applications. Their users may consist of citizens, professionals or
      both. For wellbeing application suppliers, Kanta PHR offers the interfaces and the open
      national accepted data content based on the HL7 FHIR standard. The FHIR Rest API interfaces
      are specified in the Capability Statement description. The data content is developed in
      cooperation with various actors.</p>
    <p>Application developers can integrate their own application in the sandbox environments of
      Kanta PHR for independent testing. Further information Sandbox environments.</p>
    <p>Further information about the service and the latest news are available on the Wellbeing
      data page.</p>
    <h2 id="perscriptions">Prescription centre FHIR interface</h2>
    <p>Prescription centre is a national Kanta service in which citizens' electronic prescriptions
      and electronic dispensations are saved. Main interfaces in production are based on HL7 V3
      Medical Records messaging and HL7 V3 CDA R2 documents. For metadata search of the
      prescriptions has been implemented search operation based on FHIR custom operations and FHIR
      Medication*-resources. FHIR interface includes only metadata of the prescription although the
      data content of the metadata includes a large amount of information of the actual
      prescription. For this interface there is no Sandbox environment. Kanta services has produced
      example FHIR resource instances for demo purpose and these instances can be made available
      through a server of another party participating in the demo.</p>
    <h2 id="future"></h2>Other FHIR interfaces in the future</h2>
    <p>In the future there is a plan to offer data of the Kanta services in FHIR format. This data
      can be for example diagnoses (problems), lab results, vital sign from Patient data archive
      service. Kanta services has produced example FHIR resource instances for demo purpose and
      these instances can be made available through a server of another party participating in the
      demo.</p>
